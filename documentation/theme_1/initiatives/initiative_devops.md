## Create a Privacy Policy Template 

Description: This project is created to develop a website that collects user data in compliance with GDPR regulations.To achieve this goal, there is a need to develop a privacy policy that clearly outlines the information collected, how to use it, and commitment to protecting user privacy. This policy should be based on a GDPR-compliant template that is created, which includes all required information and adheres to GDPR regulations. To facilitate development and testing of the website, you will also need to set up both local and production development environments. The local development environment will allow you to work on the website codebase without affecting the production environment, while the production environment will enable you to deploy the website for public access.

## Goals:

* Ensure compliance with GDPR regulations in the collection and use of user data on your website.
* Develop a privacy policy that clearly outlines the information you collect, how you use it, and your commitment to protecting user privacy.
* Create a local development environment that allows you to work on the website codebase without affecting the production environment.
* Set up a production development environment that enables you to deploy the website for public access.
* Develop a testing process to ensure that the website functions correctly and the privacy policy is GDPR-compliant.
* Create a privacy policy webpage that presents your privacy policy to users in a clear and concise manner.
* Provide users with the ability to easily give and withdraw consent to the collection and use of their personal data.
* Continuously monitor and update the privacy policy as needed to ensure ongoing compliance with GDPR regulations and best practices in data privacy.

## User Stories:

User Story 1: As a website owner, I want a privacy policy template that conforms to GDPR regulations, so that I can legally collect and use user data on my website.

Task 1.1: Research GDPR privacy policy requirements to determine what information must be included in the template.

Task 1.2: Write a privacy policy template that includes all required information and conforms to GDPR regulations.

User Story 2: As a website developer, I want a local development environment set up, so that I can work on the website without affecting the production environment.

Task 2.1: Install and configure a local development environment on your computer.

Task 2.2: Set up a local copy of the website codebase.

Task 2.3: Verify that the local development environment is functioning correctly.
